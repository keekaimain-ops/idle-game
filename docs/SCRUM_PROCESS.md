# Scrum Process Guide

**Project**: Idle Game  
**Version**: 1.0

## 📋 Overview

Simple scrum for a small team. Files are truth, Discord is coordination.

---

## Story Format

```
**Story [N]: [Title]**

**Description:** [One sentence summary]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. [Testable outcome 1]
2. [Testable outcome 2]
3. [Testable outcome 3]
```

## Story Points (Fibonacci)

| Points | Size | Time |
|--------|------|------|
| 1-2 | Trivial | < 2 hours |
| 3-5 | Small | 2-8 hours |
| 8 | Medium | 1-2 days |
| 13+ | Large | Break it down |

---

## Workflow

1. **Pick story** from backlog
2. **Read** STORY_OVERVIEW.md
3. **Implement** the acceptance criteria
4. **Test** each criterion
5. **Demo** to team/Jesse
6. **Mark done** and move to next

---

## Story Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| TODO | Not started |
| IN PROGRESS | Being worked on |
| BLOCKED | Waiting on something |
| DONE | All criteria met |

---

## Commit Convention

```
feat(STORY_XX): brief description
fix(STORY_XX): what was fixed
```

---

## Rules

1. **Review each story** with Jesse before moving to next
2. **Acceptance criteria are the contract** - if it's not listed, not required
3. **Quality over speed** - done right > done fast
4. **Update docs as you work** - not after

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tested and working
- [ ] Code committed
- [ ] Demo'd or verified
